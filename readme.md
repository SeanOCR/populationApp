# Code Assignment #
Interview homework for Simons Foundation

# Assumptions #

# Getting going #
To get up and running quickly 
1. ```npm install```
2. ```npm start``` // Builds app and starts server
3. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


# Application Structure #
```
├── app/               // This is the client side app
│   ├── components/    // React components
│   ├── assets/        // Static assets...if we had any
└── server/            // Server files...only one at the moment
└── tests/              // Unit tests

```

# TODO #
If I had more time here are the things I'd like to do:
1. Create more Unit tests
2. Use a HOC to wrap short country items and restrict data changes to the individal items
3. Add loading spinners to short country items
4. Add Error modal overlay and more specific error handling 
5. More responsiveness testing
